								<h2>More About El</h2>
								<p>My first taste of coding came when I had a Tumblr blog (MANY years ago) and I used some basic HTML and CSS to style it. Wow did I feel cool! I was basically a hacker. I didn't know that what I was doing could actually be a profession, so I pursued another love of mine, reading and writing. I got a BA in English Language and Literature from the University of Maryland. I found myself in many challenging yet less-than-rewarding jobs. Tech was always in the back of my mind, but I finally took the leap to pursue it by enrolling in a software engineering boot camp and it was the best leap I've ever taken.</p>
								<p>It's called a "boot camp" for a reason - it was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. But the knowledge I've gained, not just about software engineering, but about what I am capable of (can you say learning a new skill set in 6 months and producing 3 full stack applications along the way?), has been a joy to gain. I know I'm in the right career path now, and cannot wait to share my skills and learn new ones.</p>
                                <p>When I'm not working on a project I can be found practicing Seido karate (above picture is me passing my advanced blue belt test!), reading a good book, or playing Magic: The Gathering. </p>
